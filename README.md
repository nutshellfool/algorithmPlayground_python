# AlgorithmShare Python 
## a open source edition of algorithm data structure code sets
This is a Python language edition, and java edition is also avilable [algorithmShare](https://github.com/nutshellfool/algorithmShare).   
Currently, this is a pure Python project and which supports the PyCharm IDE , so you can feel free to open this project in Python.  
The unittest is using buildin unittest (maybe change this in future),  and you can run all testcase by   
```python -m unittest discover -s ./tests ``` (of course, you should run this command under the root path of this project)
