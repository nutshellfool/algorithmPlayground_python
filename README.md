# algorithmShare python a open source edition of algorithm datastructure code sets
This is a Python language edition, and java edition also avilable [algorithmShare](https://github.com/nutshellfool/algorithmShare).   
Currently, pure Python project and also support the PyCharm IDE which is one of the most useful Python IDE, so you can feel free to open this project in Python.  
The unittest is using buildin unittest (maybe change this in future),  and you can run all testcase by ```python -m unittest discover -s ./tests ``` (of course, you should run this command under the root path of this project)
